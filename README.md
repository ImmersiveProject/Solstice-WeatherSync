# Solstice-WeatherSync

Welcome to my version of qb-weather sync

Featuring full real weather and time by using 2 different api to pull weather and timezone information from the real world and implement this into your server, also sends a notification every 5mins (can be changed) that will display the current time and current weather forecast

Fully rewritten serverside code of weather sync to accomplish this while keeping all exports of the original intact so this will drag and drop into any qbcore server after setting api keys

Both api used here can be found below 

Go here to get weather api key - https://openweathermap.org/

Go here for timezone api key - https://timezonedb.com/

Both api keys will be required for this script to work

0.03 ms idle (mainly for the api http requests)
